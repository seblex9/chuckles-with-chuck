# Chuckles With Chuck - A React App 🤣

This React app serves up Chuck Norris jokes from the Chuck Norris API.

## Features 🚀

1. **Responsive Design**: ensures a smooth experience across devices.
2. **Interactivity**: Using React's `useState` hook, the app gives users fresh jokes at the click of a button.
3. **API Interaction**: Integrates with the [Chuck Norris API](https://api.chucknorris.io/) to fetch jokes seamlessly.
4. **Async/Await**: Utilizes the modern `async/await` approach for fetching jokes, ensuring non-blocking code and a fluid user experience.
5. **Dynamic Rendering**: Jokes are rendered dynamically on the page without any reloads.

## How It Works 🛠

1. User visits the site and is greeted with the "Chuckles With Chuck" title.
2. Below the title lies a button prompting the user to "Get Joke".
3. Once clicked, the app makes a `fetch` request to the Chuck Norris API.
4. The joke is fetched, processed, and dynamically displayed on the page.

## Deployment 🌐

## Final Thoughts 📝
